        `- Wu Xiang:
_Wu is simply a lack, or emptiness.
_Xiang has many meanings, but in this context refers to Buddhist concept of form or external manifestation. Often as opposed to something's intrinsic, unchanging core nature.
-Wu Xiang as a term is thus used to signify something so abstract or profound that it has no external manifestation.`,
        `Alternative:
Wu means emptiness;
Xiang means eternal manifestation.`,
